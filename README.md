# SharkByte
SharkByte is a 2D based game using pygame, a python module.
The player is given a shark avatar and they must devour the delicious fish before they manage to escape.
The health continuously decreases and the only way to regain it is to eat as many fish as quickly as possible.
There will be some poisonous fish and trash mixed in so you will have to take precautions and avoid them.
Remember: You do not have to eat all of the fish if you are not capable enough.
